I use `rsync` extensively.  It's my tool of choice for moving files between both local and remote computers.  While the mac ships with an `rsync`, it's nearly always old and outdated. With Mavericks, the currently shipped version is 2.6.9, protocol version 29 â€” and does not include full support for ACLs and xattrs (at least they are not listed in the current capabilities list).  

The following installs a modern (3.0.8) variant with patches to support the Mac file system:

```bash
curl -O http://rsync.samba.org/ftp/rsync/src/rsync-3.0.8.tar.gz
tar -xzvf rsync-3.0.8.tar.gz
rm rsync-3.0.8.tar.gz
curl -O http://rsync.samba.org/ftp/rsync/src/rsync-patches-3.0.8.tar.gz
tar -xzvf rsync-patches-3.0.8.tar.gz
rm rsync-patches-3.0.8.tar.gz
cd rsync-3.0.8
patch -p1 <patches/fileflags.diff
patch -p1 <patches/crtimes.diff
patch -p1 <patches/hfs-compression.diff
./prepare-source
./configure --prefix /usr/local --disable-debug --enable-ipv6
make
sudo make install
```

Once installed, adjust your path or call it explicitly.  You will need to install this version on both source and destination Macs if working between two computers.  To ensure `rsync` uses the correct version of `rsync` on the destination, you can call `rsync` with the `--rsync-path` parameter:

```
/usr/local/bin/rsync --rsync-path=/usr/local/bin/rsync source dest
```
