I already posted a quick summary about my praise for the legion of goodies delivered at WWDC.  It really was like Christmas for Mac and iOS developers.  I started making a list of cool stuff I wanted to play with when I got back and realized I would have to list practically everything mentioned in the keynote.  A few things that didn't necessarily seem all that interesting at the time became quite a bit more interesting after getting all the details in one of the more detailed sessions.  

Cool Stuff
Swift - duh. (Sherlocked Objective-C)
Testflight - No more UDIDs and provisioning profiles for testers. (Sherlocked old Testflight & HockeyApp)
View Debugging (Sherlocked Reveal)
Playgrounds (Sherlocked CodeRunner)
Performance XCTests and profiling
IBComponents, searching, and the other additions from iOS 7 - I might actually give IB and Storyboards another chance for iOS projects.
Adaptive UI (for the mythical new device sizes that are obviously coming soon)

Beyond these more notable and sizable items, there were an innumerable list of small,, helpful tweaks and updates to improve the developerâ€™s quality of life.
